# Java-ticket-purchase-tracker
A program that lets you enter a number of tickets to purchase, tracks how many are left to purchase, includes input error checks, 
and has a visual status indicator.  Once the tickets are sold out, a notification window pops up alerting the user to that fact, and exits
the program once the user clicks ok on the alert.
